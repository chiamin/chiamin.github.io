My research interests lies on using numerical techniques to simualte quantum many-body systems in condensed matter physics.
At low temperature, collective motion can induce interesting phenomena, for example, high-temperature superconductivity, topological phases, novel non-equalibrium quantum dynamics.
My research focuses on understanding these phenomena using computational simulations.

In particular, my research interests include the following categories:
* Developing new numerical techniques based on tensor network states and quantum Monte Carlo
* Quantum phases related to high-temperature superconductivity
* Quantum phases in cold atom systems
* Non-equalibrium dynamics and quantum transport in low-dimensional systems
