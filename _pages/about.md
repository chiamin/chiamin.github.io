My research interests lies on 1) using computational techniques to simualte quantum many-body systems in condensed matter physics,
and 2) developing new algorithms for such systems.

In particular, my research interests include the following categories:
* Developing new numerical techniques for quantum many-body systems, mainly based on tensor network states and quantum Monte Carlo
* Correlated electrons and high-temperature superconductor
* Quantum phases in cold-atom systems
* Non-equalibrium dynamics and quantum transport in low dimension
