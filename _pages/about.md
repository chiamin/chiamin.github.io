My research interests lies on using numerical techniques to simualte quantum many-body systems in condensed matter physics.

In particular, my research interests include the following categories:
* Developing new numerical techniques for quantum many-body systems, mainly based on tensor network states and quantum Monte Carlo
* Quantum phases in the models related to high-temperature superconductor
* Quantum phases in the models related to cold atom systems
* Non-equalibrium dynamics and quantum transport in low dimension
