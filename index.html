At low temperature, collective motion can induce interesting phenomena, for example, high-temperature superconductivity, topological phases, novel non-equalibrium quantum dynamics. My research focuses on understanding these phenomena using computational simulations.</p> <p>In particular, my research interests include the following categories:</p> <ul> <li>Developing new numerical techniques based on tensor network states and quantum Monte Carlo</li> <li>Quantum phases related to high-temperature superconductivity</li> <li>Quantum phases in cold atom systems</li> <li>Non-equalibrium dynamics and quantum transport in low-dimensional systems</li> </ul> </body></html>
