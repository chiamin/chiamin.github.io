abstract = {The Hubbard model is an iconic model in quantum many-body physics and has been intensely studied, especially since the discovery of high-temperature cuprate superconductors. Combining the complementary capabilities of two computational methods, we found superconductivity in both the electron- and hole-doped regimes of the two-dimensional Hubbard model with next-nearest-neighbor hopping. In the electron-doped regime, superconductivity was weaker and was accompanied by antiferromagnetic Néel correlations at low doping. The strong superconductivity on the hole-doped side coexisted with stripe order, which persisted into the overdoped region with weaker hole-density modulation. These stripe orders varied in fillings between 0.6 and 0.8. Our results suggest the applicability of the Hubbard model with next-nearest hopping for describing cuprate high–transition temperature (Tc) superconductivity. Although seemingly simple, the Hubbard model, which describes a many-body interacting system on a lattice, is difficult to investigate numerically. This has made it challenging to understand whether the model can capture the phenomenology of real materials such as high-temperature cuprate superconductors. Xu et al. made progress in answering this question by using two complementary methods to study the Hubbard model with nonzero next-nearest neighbor hopping. The researchers found that the model supports superconductivity for doping with both electrons and holes and that the ground-state pairing order parameter displays dome-like structures as a function of doping. These findings bear resemblance to the cuprate phase diagram. —Jelena Stajic}}
