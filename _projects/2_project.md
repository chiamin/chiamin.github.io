Ultracold atoms is a system that fermions or bosons are trapped by laser light and cooled down to a low enough temperature to see the quantum phenomina.
In these systems, the physical properties, for example the interaction and the lattice geometry, can be greatly controlled in the experiments.

When the temperature is low enough, the system can enter a phase called Bose-Einsten condensate which shows superfluidity (zero viscosity).
In our works, we estimate the quantum phase transition region in the transition between Mott insulator and superfluid.

In another work, we study a system with two-component bosons where a supersolid state can be stabilized.
Supersolid is a novel quantum state that breaks simutaneously the diagonal and off-diagonal symmetries.
We explore the phase diagram and the type of the transitions.
