Quantum spin liquid is an exotic phase that has no local order even at zero temperature due to the strong frustration in the lattice geometry.
However, it has so-called the topological order which is characterized by long-range entanglement and its anyon excitations.

An example of spin liquid state is the ground state of the Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice.
In our work, we study an extended model that has an exactly solvable point which can be continuously connected to the Heisenberg model.
We show that there is no phase transition between these two parameter region, and make a connection between the Heisenberg ground state, which is experimentally relavent, to the exactly solvable state which can be understood.
