The quantum spin liquid is an exotic phase that has no local order even at zero temperature due to the strong frustration in the lattice geometry.
However, it has so-called the topological order which is characterized by long-range entanglement and its anyon excitations.

An example of a spin liquid state is the ground state of the Heisenberg model on the Kagome lattice.
In our work, we study an extended model that has an exactly solvable point that can be continuously connected to the Heisenberg model.
By showing no phase transition between these two parameter regions, we make a connection between the Heisenberg ground state, which is experimentally relevant, to the exactly solvable state that we have a good understanding of.
