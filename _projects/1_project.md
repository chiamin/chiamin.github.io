Superconductivity is a phenomeno that electrons propergate without dissipation and therefore feel no resistance. 
High-temperature superconductors have been discovered since 1986, while its machenism remains one of the biggest mistary in condensed matter physics.
The main challenging is the existance of a number of competing states with extremely close energies, which requires high accuracy in the theoritical calculations.

We have a series of works on this topic. By utilizing advance computational techniques, in particular tensor network and quantum Monte Carlo, we are able to distinguish the ground state and the other low-energy states with high accuracy.

In our works, we study the ground states of the related models including the Hubbard model and its variances,
The ground state has a special spin and/or charge orderings (which is called stripes).
Superconductivity can coexist or not with the stripe order.
The goal is to understand the machenism of superconductivity throw studying these models.
