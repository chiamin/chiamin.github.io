Superconductivity is a phenomeno that electrons propergate without dissipation and therefore feel no resistance. 
High-temperature superconductors have been discovered since 1970, while its machenism remains one of the biggest mistary in condensed matter physics.
The main challenging is the existance of a number of competing states with extremely close energies, which requires high accuracy in the theoritical calculations.

We have a series of works on this topic. By utilizing advance computational techniques, in particular tensor network and quantum Monte Carlo, we are able to distinguish the ground state and the other low-energy states with high accuracy.
The ground state has a special spin and/or charge distribution.
